# Modules in Python
# Managing different files in Python is modules in python.
# All the files we need to use the snake case like all the naming of the files should be in
# smaller case and using underscores if needed.


# Once we run the main.py, __pycache__ is created everytime we run the main.py from import statement.

# It will be on .pyc extension as it is python c interpreter.

# How to Organize to your code?
# You can organize the code by having the import statements.

# Packages in Python.
# Packages are the folders that cotaining modules. Nothing but .py files.
# One of the rules of the python package we should be having the __init__.py files under the
# root directory of the package folder.

# Different ways to import

# __name__ ?
# __name__ will give the file name as the output. But, again __name__ will be the __main__ if we are
# running that file. Like, if we have a test.py and util.py imported into it. When we run test.py
# __name__ = __main__ for test.py whereas __name__ = __util__ for util.py
