# History of Data
# Types of Machine Learning
# Machine learning is simply about predicting results based on the incoming data.

# Machine Learning.
# 1. Supervised  - Classification, Regression
# 2. Unsupervised - Clustering, Assocaition Rule Learaning
# 3. Reinforcement - Skill acquisition Real time learning

# ML - Steps
# 1 - Import the data
# 2 - Clean the data
# 3 - Split data. Training Set/Test Set
# 4 - Create a Model
# 5 - Check the output
# 6 - Improve

# Tools in Machine Learning:
# Numpy - This is the package in Python, contains for lists and multi dimesional arrays
# Pandas - this is used for csv files or tabular data/ data frames.
# scikit-learn - for regressions, clustering and so on...useful for ML.
# matplotlib - help us visualise data in any different way
# **Jupyter Notebooks - these are really useful while writing the ML/Data science. We can visualise
#                      the data step by step.
# Kaggle - It is like the community for free huge amounts of datasets to play around with ML.

# Pandas - Cheatsheet : https://elitedatascience.com/python-cheat-sheet
