# Four pillars of OOP.

# E A I P

# Encapsulation

# combinig of Data and functions/methods together is called as Encapsulation.

# Abstraction
# Abstracting the things or the way how they are being implemented.
# Fro example if we are using list.count(2) we are not showing the count function actually.
# something we are hiding the actual info to get the problem resolved is abstraction.


# Private and Public Variables.

# _name will say that We are private variables.


# Inheritance
# This is covered in the new file called inheritance.py in the same folder.


# Polymorphism
# The ability to use the same method names between two different functions. In the example of
# the file inheritance.py we actually used Inheritance by using the same attack method between
# two different classes.
