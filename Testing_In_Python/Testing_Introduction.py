# Testing Introduction

# Testing is nothing but another python file.

# We have the standard library to write the unit tests in python called as "unittest"

# We create a class and name it a test and give info what ever we want to do.

# We can use the command python -m unittest -v
# This will run all the test scripts present in that folder.
# def setup() this is the default methods that we can use from unittest class.
# This setup() function will run before each and every function in the testcase() class.

# Also, we have another function called Teardown(): This will execute after executing the test case.
